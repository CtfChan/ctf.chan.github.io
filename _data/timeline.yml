- title: Perception Software Development Intern, Zebra Technologies, Toronto
  from: Aug 2018
  to: Aug 2019
  description: • Developed novel perception algorithms that expanded system coverage by over 100% and
                 reduced error rate by 50% using C++, Python, PCL and OpenCV. <br />
               • Optimized obstacle detection algorithm leading to 30% reduction in computation time
                 and 30% reduction in error rate using C++ multithreading and PCL. <br />
               • Authored two perception related patents and co-authored
                 a SLAM related patent.<br />

- title: Visiting Reseacher, Australian Center for Field Robotics, Sydney
  from: May 2018
  to: Aug 2018
  description: • Redeveloped, tested and deployed a virtual bumper system for an 
                 autonomous electric vehicle using C++, ROS, PCL and Gtest. 
                 The new design reduced the false positive rate of the system by over 
                 50%. <br /> 


- title: Autonomy Software Engineer, AuToronto, Toronto
  from: Aug 2017
  to: Aug 2019
  description: • Benchmarked various pose estimation (visual, visual-inertial & lidar)
                 algorithms and conducted extrinsic calibrations for the car using ROS,
                 C++ and MATLAB. <br />
               • Developed a robust localization system using GNSS, wheel odometry and
                 lidar using libpointmatcher, PCL and C++.<br />

- title: Visiting Reseacher, Lund University, Lund
  from: May 2017
  to: Aug 2017
  description: • Developed a fully autonomous wheelchair from scratch in C++ 
                 using the ROS navigation stack, hector_mapping, Gmapping 
                 and RTAB-MAP. <br />
               • Implemented custom PID controller as well as an odometry 
                 update program in Arduino. <br />
