# Autonomous Pick and Go Rover 

This was a group project for MIE444 (Mechatronics) at UofT. The objective of the project was to design an autonomous rover that would find a misplaced wooden block in a maze and place it at a goal point. The robot's initial position was randomly chosen so we had to solve the kidnapped robot problem.
