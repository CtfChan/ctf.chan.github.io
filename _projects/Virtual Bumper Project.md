# Virtual Bumper 

![EVs](/assets/sydney_car.jpg "USYD EVs")

I did this project during the summer of 2018 at the Australian Center for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney. Prior to my design, the vehicle's obstacle detection system was only capable of working on flat ground and was prone to frequent false positive detections. My design drastically reduced the system's false positive rates, allowed it to work on all drivable surfaces at a fraction of the previous system's runtime.
