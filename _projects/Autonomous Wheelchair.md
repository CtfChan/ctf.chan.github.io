# Autonomous Wheelchair Project

![](/assets/me_and_wheelchair.jpg)

I did this project during the summer of 2017 alongside my partner Ayaan at Lund University. Using an Xbox Kinect, a laptop and some spare electronic parts we transformed an electric wheelchair into an autonous navigation robot. This was my first full-fledged robotics project and it was an excellent learning experience.
