# Robot Exploration

![](/assets/costmap_implementation.png)

This was a group project for the course MIE443 at UofT. The objective of the project was to program a Turtlebot to autonomously explore a maze and map it using Gmapping. Our design used a combination of frontier exploration, bug algorithm and A* to explore it's environment.
